# r/oneplus Discord server bot

This repository contains the rewrite of the [Bot](https://github.com/Rithari/OnePlusBot), which is still in use. The features will be gradually be ported 
and most of them will be in [abstracto](https://github.com/Sheldan/abstracto), but some of the features need to be customized, as they are r/oneplus specific.

The migration of the existing data from the database is handled via one time migration, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Sheldan/OnePlusBot-migration).
