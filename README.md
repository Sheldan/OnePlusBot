# r/oneplus Discord server bot

This repository contains the rewrite of the [Bot](https://github.com/Rithari/OnePlusBot). It is developed by customizing [abstracto](https://github.com/Sheldan/abstracto), because some features are r/oneplus specific.

The migration of the existing data from the database is handled via one time migration, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Sheldan/OnePlusBot-migration).

The FAQ configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/Sheldan/OnePlusBot-faq/).
